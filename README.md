## Welcome to PDF Print Utility

This utility was originally created to help Loan Signing Agents and Notaries to print large PDF files with a mix of legal and letter pages.

### Printing Letter, Legal or Both

PDF documents are generated by various utilities and are very inconsistent when defining page sizes. This utility will first analyze each page in the document and determine if a page should be letter size or legal size before sending to the printer.

### Available Print Options

The utility will permit the user to:

1. Print legal and letter
2. Print letter only
3. Print legal only
4. Define page ranges to print
5. Rotate page 180 degrees
6. Specify printer
